> Heat oven to 425°F. On large rimmed baking sheet, toss onion, potatoes, poblano, and garlic with oil and 1/4 teaspoon each salt and pepper. Arrange in even layer and roast until golden brown and tender, 25 to 30 minutes.

> While vegetables roast, heat large nonstick skillet on medium. Add chorizo and cook, breaking up into tiny pieces, until browned and crisp around edges, 5 to 6 minutes; transfer to bowl. Add eggs to skillet and cook to desired doneness, 3 to 4 minutes for slightly runny yolks. Toss chorizo with vegetables, then scatter with Cheddar. Return to oven to melt if needed. Serve with eggs and tortillas if desired.
