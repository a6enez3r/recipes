> In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add chicken and season both sides with garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Cook until chicken is cooked through and no longer pink, about 8 minutes each side. Remove, slice, and set aside.

---

> Butter both sides of two slices of bread. Top with mozzarella, cooked chicken, tomato slices, basil, and more mozzarella, then top with another slice of buttered bread. Repeat with remaining ingredients.

---

> In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tablespoon butter until frothy. Working in batches, cook sandwiches until bread is golden and cheese is melted, about 3 minutes per side.
