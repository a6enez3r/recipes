* `1/2 c` sliced cucumber (skin on // organic when possible)
* `1` heaping cup cubed pineapple (if frozen, omit ice)
* `1/2` large ripe, peeled, frozen banana
* `1/4 c` light coconut milk*
* `1/2 c` filtered water
* `1` medium lime, zested + juiced (~1 tsp zest // 2 Tbsp (30 ml) juice per 1 lime)
* `1` large handful greens (spinach or kale // organic when possible)
* `2-4` ice cubes

> Add cucumber, pineapple, frozen banana, light coconut milk, water, lime zest, lime juice, greens, and ice cubes to a blender and blend on high until creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed.

> For a thicker smoothie, add more ice. For a thinner smoothie, add more liquid of choice. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lime juice or zest for acidity/brightness, banana or pineapple for sweetness, coconut milk for creaminess, and greens for more intense green color.

> Serve immediately. Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 24 hours, though best when fresh.
