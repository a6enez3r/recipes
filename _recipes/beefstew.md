> Towel dry beef pieces to remove all excess moisture. Sprinkle liberally with pepper throughout. Heat oil in large heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add beef and brown on all sides, working in batches so you don’t overcrowd the pieces (they won’t brown if overcrowded.) Transfer beef to a plate.

> Add a bit of broth to pot to loosen and scrape brown bits from bottom. Add carrots, celery, and onions and stir until softened, 5 min. Add garlic, stirring 1 minute. Add red wine; bring to simmer and simmer until liquid is halfway evaporated, about 4 minutes, stirring to loosen bottom bits.

> Quickly whisk together the flour and all broth; add to the pot with sugar. Add back the browned beef and bring to boil. Reduce to simmer, cover, and cook up to 2 hours or until beef is fork tender. Add the potatoes and mustard during the last 20 minutes of cooking. Taste and season with salt/pepper if needed. Serve warm, garnished with parsley if desired. Great over rice or with rustic bread. Leftovers are delicious.
