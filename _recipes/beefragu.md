> Serving

---

> Pat beef dry and sprinkle with salt and pepper

---

> Sear Beef: Heat 1 tbsp olive oil over high heat in a heavy based pot. Add beef and sear each piece aggressively on all sides until very browned (3 - 5 minutes in total), then remove onto a plate.

---

> Turn stove down to medium low and add remaining 2 tbsp of olive oil.

---

> Soffrito: Add garlic and onion and sauté for 2 minutes. Then add the carrots and celery and sauté slowly for 5 minutes.

---

> Add remaining Ragu ingredients and return the beef to the pot (including pooled juices). Turn the stove up and bring it to a simmer, then turn it down to low so it's bubbling very very gently.

---

> Slow cook: Cover the pot and let it cook for 2 hours or until beef is tender enough to shred. 

---

> Shred: Remove beef then coarsely shred with 2 forks. Return beef to the pot. Simmer for 30 minutes until sauce is reduced and thickened - beef will soften slightly more during this step.

---

> Final season: Do a taste test and adjust the seasoning to your taste with salt and pepper. ALSO, add 1/2 tsp sugar if sauce is a bit sour for your taste (Note 6). Place the lid on and set aside until ready to serve

---

> Bring a very large pot of water with 1 tbsp of salt to the boil.

---

> Add pasta and cook for 1 minute less than the recommended cooking time as per the packet instructions.

---

> Meanwhile, place 5 cups of the Ragu in a very large fry pan, dutch oven or use 2 normal size fry pans. Heat over high heat while the pasta is cooking.

---

> When the pasta is ready, transfer it directly from the pot into the fry pan using tongs.

---

> Add 3/4 cup of pasta water into the fry pan.

---

> Gently toss the pasta (I use 2 wooden spoons) for 1 to 2 minutes, until the sauce water evaporates and leaves you with a thick Ragu sauce that coats the pasta.

---

> Serve with plenty of freshly grated parmesan, or even better, with parmigiano reggiano.
