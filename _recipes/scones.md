* `2 c` all-purpose flour
* `1/2 c` granulated sugar
* `1/2 tsp` salt
* `2 + 1/2 tsp` baking powder
* `1/2 c` unsalted butter, frozen
* `1/2 c` heavy cream or buttermilk (plus `2 tbsp` for brushing)
* `1` large egg
* `1 + 1/2 teaspoons` pure vanilla extract

> Dough

---

* `1–1.5 c` add-ins such as chocolate chips, berries, nuts, fruit, etc
* `optional:` coarse sugar for topping

> Toppings

---

> Whisk flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Grate the frozen butter using a box grater. Add it to the flour mixture and combine with a pastry cutter, two forks, or your fingers until the mixture comes together in pea-sized crumbs. See video above for a closer look at the texture. Place in the refrigerator or freezer as you mix the wet ingredients together.

---

> Whisk 1/2 cup heavy cream, the egg, and vanilla extract together in a small bowl. Drizzle over the flour mixture, add the add-ins, then mix together until everything appears moistened.

---

> To make triangle scones: Pour onto the counter and, with floured hands, work dough into a ball as best you can. Dough will be sticky. If it’s too sticky, add a little more flour. If it seems too dry, add 1-2 more Tablespoons heavy cream. Press into an 8-inch disc and, with a sharp knife or bench scraper, cut into 8 wedges. For smaller scones, press dough into two 5-inch discs and cut each into 8 wedges. To make 10-12 drop scones: Keep mixing dough in the bowl until it comes together. Drop scones, about 1/4 cup of dough each, 3 inches apart on a lined baking sheet. To make mini (petite) scones, see recipe note.

---

> Brush scones with remaining heavy cream and for extra crunch, sprinkle with coarse sugar. (You can do this before or after refrigerating in the next step.)

---

> Place scones on a plate or lined baking sheet (if your fridge has space!) and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.

---

> Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).

---

> Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or silicone baking mat(s). If making mini or drop scones, use 2 baking sheets. After refrigerating, arrange scones 2-3 inches apart on the prepared baking sheet(s).

---

> Bake for 18-26 minutes or until golden brown around the edges and lightly browned on top. Larger scones take closer to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool for a few minutes. 

---

> Leftover scones keep well at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for 5 days.
